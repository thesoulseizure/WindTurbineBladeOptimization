# Wind Turbine Blade Design Optimization

## Overview
This project leverages machine learning to predict the performance of wind turbine blades based on material properties, geometry, and operating conditions. It builds on ANSYS simulation data for a blade made of Aluminium Alloy, extending the analysis to a broader range of conditions using a synthetic dataset. A Flask web app allows users to input design parameters and get predictions for deformation, stress, strain, factor of safety, fatigue life, and damage, enabling engineers to optimize blade designs without running time-intensive simulations.

The app is deployed at [insert Render URL here, e.g., https://wind-turbine-blade-optimization.onrender.com].

## Project Goals
- Predict wind turbine blade performance metrics (deformation, stress, strain, factor of safety, fatigue life, and damage) using machine learning.
- Enable optimization of blade design by exploring different materials, geometries, and operating conditions.
- Deploy a user-friendly web app for interactive predictions, making the tool accessible to engineers and researchers.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.10.17
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and synthetic dataset generation.
  - `scikit-learn`: Random Forest Regressor for multi-output prediction.
  - `joblib`: Saving and loading the trained model.
  - `numpy`: Numerical operations for data generation and processing.
  - `flask`: Web app framework for building the interactive interface.
  - `gunicorn`: WSGI server for deployment on Render.
- **Development Environment**: Local machine with zsh shell (macOS/Linux).
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for repository management.
- **Deployment Platform**: Render (free tier).
- **Hardware**: Standard laptop (no GPU required).

## Methodology
1. **Data Generation**:
   - Used simulation results from ANSYS Workbench (Transient Structural, Modal, Harmonic, and Fatigue analyses) as a baseline:
     - Material: Aluminium Alloy.
     - Deformation: 0.046712 mm.
     - Stress (Von-Mises): 1.385 MPa.
     - Strain: 7.73732e-6.
     - Factor of Safety: 15.
     - Fatigue Life: 1e6 cycles.
     - Damage: 1000.
   - Generated a synthetic dataset (`wind_turbine_blade_data.csv`) with 150 data points by varying:
     - Material Properties: Young’s Modulus (50–90 GPa), Density (2500–3000 kg/m³), Poisson’s Ratio (0.3–0.35).
     - Geometry: Blade Thickness (3–7 mm), Blade Length (0.8–1.2 m).
     - Operating Conditions: Pressure (80,000–120,000 Pa), Frequency (200–400 Hz).
   - Scaled the performance metrics (deformation, stress, strain, etc.) based on physical relationships (e.g., deformation scales inversely with Young’s Modulus).

2. **Modeling**:
   - Loaded the synthetic dataset and split it into 80% training and 20% testing sets (`random_state=42` for reproducibility).
   - Trained a Random Forest Regressor (`n_estimators=100`) to predict all six performance metrics simultaneously.
   - Evaluated the model:
     - Training R² Score: ~0.98 (indicating a good fit to the training data).
     - Testing R² Score: ~0.93 (indicating strong generalization to unseen data).
   - Saved the trained model as `rf_blade_model.pkl` for use in the web app.

3. **Web App Development**:
   - Built a Flask web app (`app.py`) to serve predictions:
     - `/` route: Displays an input form (`index.html`) for users to enter design parameters.
     - `/predict` route: Processes inputs, makes predictions using the Random Forest model, and displays results (`result.html`).
   - Designed user-friendly templates with basic CSS styling for a clean interface.
   - Configured the app to run on port 5002 locally to avoid conflicts with other projects.

4. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Added a `requirements.txt` file listing all dependencies for reproducibility.
   - Included a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., Python cache, virtual environments) while keeping the model file (`rf_blade_model.pkl`).
   - Pushed the project to GitHub (`https://github.com/thesoulseizure/WindTurbineBladeOptimization`) for deployment on Render.
